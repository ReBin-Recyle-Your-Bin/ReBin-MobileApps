## ReBin Project Background
The issue of waste in Indonesia has become increasingly complex, with communities generating 17.6 million tons of waste annually, of which only 67.4% is effectively managed. This leaves 32.6% of waste unmanaged due to low awareness of waste management practices, resulting in environmental pollution, health issues, and economic losses. A significant challenge is the identification and proper management of various waste types, worsened by inadequate education on disposal and recycling. Our goal is to address these challenges with an innovative solution: an application that accurately identifies waste types, educates on recycling processes, and promotes sustainable waste management practices nationwide.
